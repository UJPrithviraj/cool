# Rock Paper Scissors ft. Fire & Water

 This is my personal project that i decided to make in my free time.

# HOW IT WORKS
1) It uses a nested dictionary to hold the various possible outcomes. 
2) After asking the user input, it opens the dictionary by converting it into a list so that it can use the random.choice method to let the computer choose the  
    key.
3) It then uses a bunch of if-conditionals and cycles through the nested key-value pairs based on the user input to chose the nested value that determines the  
    outcome.
4) It also has a preventive meaasure that makes sure that a wrong input is not given whether that is by messing up the case sensitivity or the word itself.
