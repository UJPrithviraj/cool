# Rock Paper Scissors ft. Fire & Water  

This is my personal project that I decided to make in my free time.  

## How It Works  

1. It uses a nested dictionary to hold the various possible outcomes.  
2. After asking the user input, it opens the dictionary by converting it into a list so that it can use the `random.choice` method to let the computer choose the key.  
3. It then goes through the nested key-value pairs based on the user input to choose the nested value that determines the outcome by randomizing the computer's input.  
4. It also has a preventive measure that makes sure that a wrong input is not given, whether that is by messing up the case sensitivity or the word itself.
